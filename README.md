# Battery-Size-Optimization-for-Battery-Electric-Buses-in-urban-Public-Transport
This repository presents a reproducible framework for optimal battery sizing of battery electric buses. The framework integrates route-level profiling, clustering, and optimization using real-world urban public transport data. The provided code supports reproduction and independent verification of the main results reported in the study.
Datasets

This repository provides two datasets used to support the methodology and reproduce the results of the study:
**1) Clustering-Dataset.xlsx**
This dataset contains integrated route-level profiles for all routes in the study. It is used to apply various clustering techniques to group routes with similar operational characteristics.
**2) Kmeans-Clustered-Dataset.xlsx**
This dataset contains the route clusters obtained by applying the K-Means clustering technique to the Clustering-Dataset.xlsx. These clusters are subsequently used for battery sizing optimization and validation steps.
